                    <p class="article-description">Working in a lab at UTD to investigate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This particular work evalutates the ability of models to combine visual and textual elements, factor in contemporary knowledge, and recognize fallacious reasoning. To accomplish this, our lab is producing annotations that represent the stepwise human reasoning proess. This data can then be used to evaluate the multimodal reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models. <a href="https://profiles.utdallas.edu/vince">Link to professor's page.</a></p>

                    <div class="article-grid">
                        <p class="article-description">Worked with a small team of students to produce a noise calculation application that conforms to IEC standards. Specifically Emerson needs to approximate the sound produced by their machines to ensure that they stay below city ordinance maximums. Their former method of calcuation was accomplished via manual calcuation with Excel sheets, which was prone to human error. Our solution leverages the IEC formulas to automate the process. An Emerson engineer could instead input all of the sensor data and automatically automatically receive the noise calculation. <a href="https://www.emerson.com/en-us">Link to Emerson's website</a></p>
